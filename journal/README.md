# Journal App
## Motivation
Learn the ins and outs of using text files (working with binary files comes later).

After watching the lesson I found that the app was too simple. I decided to reorganize that spec a little bit to give me experience with the subproccess module and basic class design.

Note: This is unfinished. I decided to move on to the next topic. The problem becam uninteresting.

## What I learned
- Learned the basics of the subprocess module
- working with system paths in a platform independent manner
- importing local modules
