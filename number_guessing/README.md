# Number Guessing
## Instructions
- run main.py
- ...that's it. Just follow instructions
### Motivation
This is a very simple app that is used to gain familiarity with the course in general and to get used to a new environment

#### What was learned
- alt-enter in Pycharm is pretty cool
- getting raw user input
- runtime type checking using the type() function
    - Bad idea in most cases to enforce types in python. The program loses the generic nature that the language provides as a default
- type conversions
- Every object can be tested for validity.
    - This is exactly like testing pointers in C
    - In fact that is probably what is going on here since every variable in python is just a void pointer in C
- Introduction to string formatting with the .format() method. Looks to be very rich with functionality. Only used very basically in this file project though
